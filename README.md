## üë∑ Contributions
Bug fixes and quality of life improvements are welcome!
This includes stuff like custom enemy properties and new animations.

Avoid major additions that will potentially cause bugs or complicate the game/code (Stuff like powerups).
I appreciate the help, but the goal is to continue the mod while I am busy. Major changes will only increase my workload and make the mod even buggier.
